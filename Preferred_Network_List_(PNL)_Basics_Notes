Mission:
Two dual-band monitor mode capable WiFi interfaces are present on the user machine. A few WiFi clients are probing for known networks in the vicinity. Use installed tools to answer the following questions:

1. How many clients are probing?
2. What is the Preferred Network List (PNL) length of the client with MAC address 02:00:00:00:03:00?
3. Which network has a higher priority for the client with MAC address 02:00:00:00:04:00?

2. Hostapd and Wpa-supplicant are installed on the machine.
